**2. Market Overview (2018--2022)**

Between 2018 and 2021, the global luxury interior fabric market
experienced steady growth, buoyed by increasing consumer interest in
high-end home décor, rising urbanization, and a burgeoning middle-class
segment in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.

However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 introduced a
temporary setback. With supply chain disruptions, lockdowns, and a sharp
decline in discretionary spending, the industry saw reduced demand
during 2020. By mid-2021, a recovery was underway, led by increased
online sales and a renewed focus on home improvement.

The geopolitical instability caused by the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022
had an additional ripple effect on global manufacturing, logistics, and
trade. Rising raw material costs, fuel price volatility, and currency
fluctuations contributed to a shift in procurement strategies across
regions.

Despite these challenges, the market was valued at approximately USD XX
million in 2022 and has been projected to recover and reach new growth
milestones in the coming years.
